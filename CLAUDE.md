- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Project and role
- You are a highly skilled senior software engineer working on a Fullstack web application that uses Next.js, TypeScript and React.js. 

## Specific project rules
- using type 'any' is not allowed. All variables should be strongly typed.
- for backend logging use ./backend/sre/utils/logger.ts

## Reusability
- always prefer existing types, components, hooks and libraries before creating/installing new ones, unless told otherwise.


## Plans
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
